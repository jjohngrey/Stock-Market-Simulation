# Stock Market Simulation

## What will the application do?
My project will **simulate a stock market with one made-up stock**. The user will be given time to buy/share any number of shares that they can afford with the starting investment as the made-up stock is simulated to rise/fall. The goal is to make as much profit as possible within the time limit. 

## Who will use it?
Users who want to learn about how a stock market operates on a microscale (daytraders)!

## Why is this project of interest to you?
This project is of interested to me because I did a stock market competition last year and really enjoyed it. I think it's very fun and it can simulate the market (considering I'm also a _business_ _major_).
