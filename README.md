# Stock Market Simulation

## What will the application do?
My project will **simulate a stock market with two made-up stocks**. The user will be given time to buy/share any number of shares that they can afford with the starting investment as the made-up stock is simulated to rise/fall. The goal is to make as much profit as possible within the time limit. 

## Who will use it?
Users who want to learn about how a stock market operates on a microscale (daytraders)!

## Why is this project of interest to you?
This project is of interest to me because I did the high school stock market competition with Rotman Interactive Trader last year, placed fourth and enjoyed the whole experience. I wanted to see if I could also simulate the market in my own project.


## User Stories:
* As a user, I want to be able to create a buy order of X number of shares and add it to my order list.
* As a user, I want to be able to create a sell order of X number of shares and add it to my order list.
* As a user, I want to be able to view a list of my past orders, longs or shorts.
* As a user, I want to be able to view my profit/loss as I am making my trades.
* As a user, I want to be able to see the ticker prices as they are being updated.
* As a user, I want to be able to have the option to save my stock orders to file.
* As a user, I want to be able to have the option to load my stock orders from file.

## Instructions for Use:
* Click buy and sell to buy a certain number of shares.
* View your number of shares of each stock and the updated price of each stock at the top.
* View only a specific stock's order history by clicking the CRZY or TAME button beside History to view only CRZY or only TAME stocks.
